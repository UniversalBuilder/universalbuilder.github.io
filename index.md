# Resources for the life scientist

You will find here scripts, documents, code snippets and more than can be used to build larger applications.
This is a work in progress, and if you find bugs or errors don't hesitate to notify me !

## Resources for learning and working with bio-image processing and analysis

## 1. Basic

### 1.1. Image Analysis Notions for the Microscopist

*Basic notions and concepts like digital images, DPI, scale, interpolation, filtering, and much more using various media to illustrate them: macros, notebooks, PDFs...*

## 2. Advanced

*This section is adressed to scientists who already have some programming notions. You will find more advanced topics like python scripting, machine learning, automation using various tools.*

#### 2.1. Python and Microscopy

![Preview](images/github_repo_python_and_microscopy.png)

*Collection of Jupyter notebooks. Inspired by [Python for Microscopists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34rW-HtPJulxr5wp2Xa04w/featured) Youtube channel, by [Dr Sreenivas B.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bnsreenu/) adapted for the format, but it also contains scripts of my own, and maybe other external additions in the future.*

## 3. Fiji

*Fiji scripts and ImageJ macros. Some simple applications, and tools meant to be used as building blocks for more complex projects.*

## 5. About me

![me](images/yannick_krempp.jpg)

I work as technical manager and imaging expert at the **Cellular Imaging Facility**, Lausanne, Switzerland. My focus is on helping researchers to be able to analyze the data they acquire on our instruments.
If you're curious about the facility, head to [the CIF website](https://cif.unil.ch), that I'm also webmastering.
