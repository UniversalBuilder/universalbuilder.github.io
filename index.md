## Resources for the scientific imaging community

You will find here scripts, documents, code snippets and more than can be used to build larger applications.
This is a work in progress, and if you find bugs or errors don't hesitate to notify me !

### Resources

#### 1. Documents

1.1. [Basic Digital Imaging Notions](https://github.com/UniversalBuilder/Resources-for-the-Life-Scientist/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Basic_Digital_Imaging_Notions.ipynb) : Concepts like digital images, DPI, scale, interpolation, using a Jupyter Notebook to illustrate them.


#### 2. Python

**Code samples** inspired by [Python for Microscopists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34rW-HtPJulxr5wp2Xa04w/featured) Youtube channel, by [Dr Sreenivas B.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bnsreenu/)

I work as technical manager and imaging expert at the **Cellular Imaging Facility**, Lausanne, Switzerland. My focus is on helping researchers to be able to analyze the data they acquire on our instruments.
If you're curious about the facility, head to [the CIF website](https://cif.unil.ch), that I'm also webmastering.
